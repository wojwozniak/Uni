    "## Optimization for Neural Networks\n",
    "The **backpropagation algorithm** is the foundational algorithm in deep learning. In this task You will have to go through a single iteration of said algorithm and compare the results after updating networks weights. <br>\n",
    "You are given a neural network with one input layer consisting of two input nodes ${n_1, n_2}$, one hidden layer with two neurons ${n_3, n_4}$ and an output layer with a single node $n_5$. We will denote the weight connecting $n_i$ to $n_j$ as $w_{i,j}$. A bias related to $n_i$ will be denoted as $b_i$. Parameters are initialized as follows:\n",
    "* $w_{1,3} = 1.5$ ; $w_{2,3} = -2.5$ ; $b_{3} = 0.3$\n",
    "* $w_{1,4} = 1$ ; $w_{2,4} = -2.5$ ; $b_{4} = 0.2$\n",
    "* $w_{3,5} = 4$ ; $w_{4,5} = 3$ ; $b_{5} = -0.8$ <br>\n",

    "Additionally, neurons $n_3$ and $n_4$ are equipped with the sigmoid activation function: $\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} $<br>\n",
    "Your task is to use two training examples: $x = \\{ (1,2), (2,0)\\}$, $y = \\{-1, 6\\}$ to preform a single backpropagation step - preform forward calculations and propagate the received error backwards, updating the weights. After all weights have been updated, check how the predictions change, preforming additional forward pass."
